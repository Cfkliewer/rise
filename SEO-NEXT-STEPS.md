## ⚠️ IMPORTANT REMINDERS

### **Keep This Information Consistent EVERYWHERE:**

**Business Name:** 822 Athletics (always same spelling, no variations)
**Address:** 14310 N. Lincoln Blvd., Ste. 300, Edmond, OK 73013
**Phone:** (405) 361-3471 (always same format with area code in parentheses)

❌ **DON'T:**
- Use different business names (like "822 Athletics Edmond" vs "822 CrossFit")
- Abbreviate the address differently (like "Ste 300" vs "Suite 300")
- Use different phone formats (like "405.361.3471" vs "(405) 361-3471")

✅ **DO:**
- Use the EXACT same format everywhere
- This is called NAP consistency (Name, Address, Phone)
- Google uses this to verify you're a real business

Your task is to redesign this webpage to be an incredible marketing homepage for this gym. I want it to be creative and unique. Really push the limits of your design. Make sure it represents a gym (crossfit gym) and really pushes the idea of community. 

Create FIVE different designs. Each design should be unique from all the others that you create. They should be hosted on /1 /2 /3 /4 and /5 respectively. 

Use your frontend design skill to make these designs exceptional. 

Use the attached image as inspiration but do not directly copy it. 

Features like parallax are welcomed but not required.
